  LetsCode Online IDE
</h1>

![demo](public/session.png)

#### The initial intent of this project was to create a session base IDE (I am currently working on the terminal which will be intergrated ) that allows teachers to create a session (they can upload a pdf file) for exams instead of writing code on a paper, students will have to join a session with the session id generated by the teacher when creating the session, after a successful connection they will be directed to the main page, just like in the image below :point_down:, they would be automatically disconnected if thier mouse leaves the page or if they change the window(They will be notified when the mouse is about to leave the page).

## Compiler page :point_down:
